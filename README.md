# Problem Solving with Python — Chapter YY: ZZ

This repository contains the chapter and active-learning exercise code associated with this chapter in the book *Problem Solving with Python: Using Computational Thinking in Everyday Life* by Michael D. Smith (2026), which is available from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262383677/problem-solving-with-python/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Python-Computational-Thinking/dp/0262552841/).

## Getting started

You will need:

- an integrated development environment (IDE)
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip` (usually included with Python)

If you need help getting started with an IDE, please read [my short introduction to "Understanding and Selecting an IDE"](https://ctps.io/select_ide.html).

Otherwise, in your IDE's terminal window, type the following commands:

```bash
